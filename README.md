Boolzapp is a messaging platform that replicates the graphics of WhatsApp with some additional features.

## Features

- Replica of WhatsApp graphics with messages differentiated by color (green for user, white for interlocutor).
- Dynamic display of the contact list.
- Dynamic message display for each contact.

### Adding a Message

- The user can write a text at the bottom, and by pressing "enter", the text is added to the conversation thread above as a green message.
